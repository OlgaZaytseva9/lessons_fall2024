			<p>
				The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing <mark>2 to 4.5 metres</mark> (6 to 15 feet) tall in
				cultivation and up to 15 m (49
				ft) in the wild, though more typically 2 to 10 m (6.5 to 33 ft). When cultivated, the size, shape and
				branch
				density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. Apple trees may naturally have a
				rounded
				to erect
				crown with a dense canopy of leaves. The bark of the trunk is dark gray or gray-brown, but young
				branches
				are reddish
				or dark-brown with a smooth texture. When young twigs are covered in very fine downy hairs and become
				hairless as
				they become older.

			<h3 id="fruit">Fruit</h3>
			<p>
				The fruit is a <span>pome</span> that matures in late <mark>summer or autumn</mark>. The true fruits
				or
				carpels are the harder interior
				chambers inside the apple's core. There are usually five carpels inside an apple, but there may be
				as
				few as
				three. Each
				of the chambers contains one or two seeds. The edible flesh is formed from the receptacle at the
				base of
				the
				flower.
			</p>
			<h3 id="chemistry">Chemistry</h3>
			<p>
				Important volatile compounds in apples that contribute to their scent and flavour include
				acetaldehyde,
				ethyl acetate,
				1-butanal, ethanol, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, ethyl propionate, ethyl
				2-methylpropionate, ethyl
				butyrate, ethyl
				2-methyl butyrate, hexanal, 1-butanol, 3-methylbutyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, 1-propyl
				butyrate,
				ethyl
				pentanoate, amyl acetate, 2-methyl-1-butanol, trans-2-hexenal, ethyl hexanoate, hexanol.
			</p>
			<h2 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>
			<p>
				The apple as a species has more than 100 alternative scientific names, or synonyms. In modern
				times,
				Malus pumila
				and Malus domestica are the two main names in use. M. pumila is the older name, but M. domestica
				has
				become much more
				commonly used starting in the 21st century, especially in the western world. Two proposals were
				made to
				make M.
				domestica a conserved name: the earlier proposal was voted down by the Committee for Vascular
				Plants of
				the IAPT in
				2014, but in April 2017 the Committee decided, with a narrow majority, that the newly popular
				name
				should be
				conserved. The General Committee of the IAPT decided in June 2017 to approve this change,
				officially
				conserving M.
				domestica. Nevertheless, some works published after 2017 still use M. pumila as the correct
				name, under
				an alternate
				taxonomy.
			</p>
			<h2 id="cultivation">Cultivation</h2>
			<h3 id="history">History</h3>
			<p>
				The apple is thought to have been domesticated 4,000–10,000 years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and
				then to have
				travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from
				Siberia (M.
				baccata), the Caucasus (M. orientalis), and Europe (M. sylvestris). Only the M. sieversii trees growing
				on the western
				side of the Tian Shan mountains contributed genetically to the domesticated apple, not the isolated
				population on the
				eastern side.
			</p>
			<h3 id="breeding">Breeding</h3>

			<p>
				Many apples grow readily from seeds. However, apples must be propagated asexually to obtain cuttings
				with the
				characteristics of the parent. This is because seedling apples are "extreme heterozygotes". Rather than
				resembling their
				parents, seedlings are all different from each other and from their parents. Triploid cultivars have an
				additional
				reproductive barrier in that three sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding
				unequal
				segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed
				(apples are an
				example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.

			<h3 id="pollination">Pollination</h3>
			<p>
				Apples are self-incompatible; they must cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the flowering each
				season, apple
				growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees
				are also used
				as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards,
				but not usually
				in sufficient number to be significant pollinators.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cultivars are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average 30-day blossom period, with
				pollinizers
				selected from cultivars within a 6-day overlap period. There are four to seven pollination groups in
				apples, depending
				on climate:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Group A – Early flowering, 1 to 3 May in England (<mark>'Gravenstein', 'Red Astrachan'</mark>)
				</li>
				<li>
					Group B – 4 to 7 May (<mark>'Idared', 'McIntosh'</mark>)
				</li>
				<li>
					Group C – Mid-season flowering, 8 to 11 May (<mark>'Granny Smith', 'Cox's Orange Pippin'</mark>)
				</li>
				<li>
					Group D – Mid/late season flowering, 12 to 15 May (<mark>'Golden Delicious', 'Calville blanc
						d'hiver'</mark>)
				</li>
				<li>
					Group E – Late flowering, 16 to 18 May (<mark>'Braeburn', 'Reinette d'Orléans'</mark>)
				</li>
				<li>
					Group F – 19 to 23 May (<mark>'Suntan'</mark>)
				<li>
					Group H – 24 to 28 May (<mark>'Court-Pendu Gris'</mark> – also called Court-Pendu plat)
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="maturation">Maturation and harvest</h3>
			<p>
				Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.
				Some cultivars,
				if left unpruned, grow very large—letting them bear more fruit, but making harvesting more difficult.
				Depending on tree
				density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear 40–200 kg (90–440
				lb) of apples
				each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using
				three-point ladders that
				are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks bear about 10–80 kg
				(20–180 lb) of fruit
				per year.
			</p>
			<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
			<p>Commercially, apples can be stored for months in controlled atmosphere chambers. Apples are commonly
				stored in chambers
				with lowered concentrations of oxygen to reduce respiration and slow softening and other changes if the
				fruit is already
				fully ripe. The gas ethylene is used by plants as a hormone which promotes ripening, decreasing the time
				an apple can be
				stored. For storage longer than about six months the apples are picked earlier, before full ripeness,
				when ethylene
				production by the fruit is low. However, in many varieties this increases their sensitivity to carbon
				dioxide, which
				also must be controlled.</p>

			<h3 id="diseases">Pests and diseases</h3>
			<p>
				Apple trees are susceptible to fungal and bacterial diseases, and to damage by insect pests. Many
				commercial orchards
				pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. These
				prohibit the use
				of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for
				instance, introducing
				its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.
			</p>
			<p>
				A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant. Three of the more common diseases or pests are
				mildew, aphids,
				and apple scab.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4 id="mildew">Mildew</h4>
					<p>
						Mildew is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and
						flowers, normally in spring.
						The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly. This can be treated
						similarly to
						Botrytis—eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are
						among recommended
						actions.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4 id="aphids">Aphids</h4>
					<p>
						Aphids are small insects with sucking mouthparts. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples:
						apple grain aphid, rosy
						apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be
						identified by color, time
						of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear). Aphids
						feed on foliage
						using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain
						species reduce tree growth
						and vigor.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4 id="applescab">Apple scab</h4>
					<p>
						Apple scab: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that
						later turn brown and
						become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar
						brown spots with velvety or
						cork-like <br>Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the
						ground and spreads during
						warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.
