			Throughout history, <span>Ukrainian women</span> have played crucial roles in advancing <mark>scientific
				knowledge</mark>
			across
			various
			disciplines. Despite facing <mark>numerous challenges</mark>, many Ukrainian women scientists have made
			groundbreaking
			contributions
			that shaped modern science. Here’s a look at some of the most prominent figures.
		</p>
		<h2 class="subtitle" id="yushchenko">
			1. Kateryna Yushchenko (1919–2001) – Computer Science Pioneer
		</h2>
		<p class="text red">
			Kateryna Yushchenko was a trailblazer in the field of <span>computer science</span>. She became the first
			person to
			develop a
			high-level programming language, called <span>Address Programming Language</span> (APL). Yushchenko’s work
			laid the
			foundation for
			the development of modern programming languages. In the 1950s and 60s, she worked on one of the earliest
			Soviet
			computers, contributing to the mathematical and programming theory. Her work had a significant impact on how
			software
			and algorithms were developed in the Soviet Union, paving the way for future advances in computational
			methods
			worldwide.
		</p>
		<h2 class="subtitle" id="zankovetska">
			2. Maria Zankovetska (1854–1934) – Cultural Impact on Science and Education
		</h2>
		<p class="text green">
			While Maria Zankovetska is best known as an <span>actress and cultural figure</span>, her influence extended
			into the
			scientific
			community, especially in the fields of education and the preservation of Ukrainian heritage. She advocated
			for women's
			education and encouraged girls to pursue learning in sciences. Zankovetska’s cultural efforts provided a
			social
			environment that indirectly supported scientific advancement by fostering intellectual curiosity among women
			in Ukraine.
		</p>
		<h2 class="subtitle" id="bohomolets">
			3. Olha Bohomolets (born 1966) – Dermatologist and Politician
		</h2>
		<p class="text green">
			Olha Bohomolets is a prominent <span>dermatologist and academic</span>. As a professor at Bogomolets
			National Medical
			University, she
			advanced research in dermatology, particularly focusing on melanoma and skin diseases. Bohomolets has
			authored over 70
			scientific papers and was instrumental in developing telemedicine practices in Ukraine, which help extend
			healthcare
			services to remote areas. She is also known for her work in the political sphere, advocating for healthcare
			reform and
			medical research funding.
		</p>
		<h2 class="subtitle" id="skoropadsky">
			4. Yelyzaveta Skoropadsky (1898–1976) – Biochemist and Neurologist
		</h2>
		<p class="text blue">
			Yelyzaveta Skoropadsky, a member of the famous Skoropadsky family, pursued a career in biochemistry and
			neurology,
			focusing her research on <span>brain function and diseases</span>. After leaving Ukraine, she continued her
			scientific
			work in
			Germany, where she conducted research on neurochemical processes and their relation to mental disorders. Her
			work
			contributed to the understanding of neurotransmitters and brain metabolism, particularly in the study of
			depression and
			schizophrenia.
		</p>
		<h2 class="subtitle" id="yermolyeva">
			5. Zinaida Yermolyeva (1898–1974) – Microbiologist and Developer of Soviet Penicillin
		</h2>
		<p class="text">
			Zinaida Yermolyeva was a distinguished <span>microbiologist</span> who made significant strides in
			bacteriology. She is
			best known
			for her work in developing penicillin in the Soviet Union during World War II. Yermolyeva’s research saved
			countless
			lives by making the antibiotic available to Soviet soldiers. In addition to her work on penicillin, she
			studied cholera
			and other infectious diseases, contributing to public health in the Soviet Union.
		</p>
		<h2 class="subtitle" id="shulga">
			6. Natalia Shulga – Molecular Biologist and Science Advocate
		</h2>
		<p class="text">
			Natalia Shulga is a molecular biologist whose work has had a lasting influence on the scientific community
			in Ukraine.
			As a co-founder of the <span>Ukrainian Science Club</span>, she advocates for the integration of Ukrainian
			scientists
			into the global
			research community. Shulga’s research has focused on molecular genetics and the environmental impact of
			various
			biological processes. She is also an advocate for science diplomacy and the promotion of women in STEM
			(Science,
			Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields in Ukraine.
		</p>
		<h2 class="subtitle" id="yudkivska">
			7. Ganna Yudkivska (born 1973) – Legal Scientist and Human Rights Advocate
		</h2>
		<p class="text">
			Though not a scientist in the traditional sense, Ganna Yudkivska’s work in legal science has had profound
			implications
			for <span>international law and human rights</span>. As a judge of the European Court of Human Rights, she
			has
			contributed to the
			development of legal principles that govern humanitarian law. Her focus on the rule of law, democracy, and
			the
			protection of human rights represents a significant intellectual contribution to legal science.
		</p>
		<h2 class="subtitle" id="virchenko">
			8. Nina Virchenko (1930–2020) – Mathematician
		</h2>
		<p class="text">
			Nina Virchenko was one of Ukraine’s leading mathematicians, specializing in differential equations. She
			authored over
			300 papers and several monographs, focusing on the application of <span>mathematical methods in mechanics
				and physics</span>.
			Virchenko was a long-time professor at the National Technical University of Ukraine (Kyiv Polytechnic
			Institute), where
			she mentored many young mathematicians and contributed to the development of mathematical education in
			Ukraine.
